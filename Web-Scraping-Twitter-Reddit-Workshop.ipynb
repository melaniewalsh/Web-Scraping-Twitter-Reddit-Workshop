    "How can we collect social media data ethically — in a way that respects users' privacy, safety, and creative production? This question is not a footnote or an afterthought. This question instead needs to be asked at the very beginning of any project that will collect and analyze social media data — as well as at every subsequent step in the project.\n",
    "\n",
    "In my [online textbook](https://melaniewalsh.github.io/Intro-Cultural-Analytics/Data-Collection/User-Ethics-Legal-Concerns.html), I discuss that it is generally considered legal to collect publicly available social media data. Just because something is legal does not mean it is ethical, however. Collecting, sharing, and publishing internet data created by or about individuals can lead to unwanted public scrutiny, harm, and other negative consequences for those individuals. For these reasons, some researchers attempt to anonymize internet data before sharing it or before publishing an article that cites a post specifically. Yet anonymizing internet data also does not give credit to internet users as creators and authors.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is no single, simple answer to the many difficult questions raised by internet data collection. It is important to develop an ethical framework that responds to the specifics of your particular research project or use case (e.g., the platform, the people involved, the context, the potential consequences, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "Below are a few examples of how researchers have approached social media data in published research:\n",
    "\n",
    "* In Maria Antoniak, David Mimno, and Karen Levy's [article about  a Reddit subcommunity dedicated to birthstories (r/BabyBumps)](https://maria-antoniak.github.io/resources/2019_cscw_birth_stories.pdf), they paraphrased Reddit submissions discussed in the article and then deleted all collected Reddit data after the article was published. \n",
    "\n",
    "* In Deen Freelon, Charlton McIlwain, and Meredith D. Clark's [report about the #BlackLivesMatter movement](https://cmsimpact.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/beyond_the_hashtags_2016.pdf), they included links to tweets rather than the full text of tweets and only linked to tweets with a minimum of 100 retweets published by Twitter users who had at least 3,000 followers or were verified. They embargoed their Twitter data for a year and then publicly released a list of tweet IDs. Tweet IDs can be used by third-parties to re-download any tweets that have not been deleted yet, as I discuss in the lesson [\"Twitter Data Sharing\"](https://melaniewalsh.github.io/Intro-Cultural-Analytics/Data-Collection/Twitter-Data-Sharing.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "* In Moya Bailey's [article about the #GirlsLikeUs hashtag](http://www.digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/9/2/000209/000209.html), created by trans advocate Janet Mock, she asked for Mock's permission to work on the project before it began and collaborated with Mock to develop research questions and determine the project's direction."

    "An Application Programming Interface (API) allows you to programmatically extract and interact with data under the hood of websites, social networks, and other projects that make their data publicly available. Twitter and Reddit both offer APIs that allow users to access their data. However, because these APIs are controlled by the companies themselves, they also come with limitations. For example, Twitter does not allow users to collect tweets more than one week in the past without a paid subscription.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another way that you might collect data from the internet or social media is via web scraping. When you get data from an API, you're getting data from an internal source (from \"inside\" Twitter). When you \"scrape\" the surface of a web page, you're getting data from the user-facing surface of a web page, just like the web page you would pull up if you opened Chrome and typed \"twitter.com\". This makes web scraping sometimes clunky and unreliable when compared to an API, although it's often the only option if there's not an available API or the API does not offer what you're looking for."
